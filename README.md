Pros: Speeds up the process of looking for code online, gives a good starting point. IF you are lost, it can be great for getting an understanding of a problem, and can help with debugging
Cons: Doesn't work most of the time, requires prior knowledge when using it. Sometimes, bugs can slip through. Can be inconsistent at times.
